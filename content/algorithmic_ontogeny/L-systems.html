<span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ecursion lies at the bottom, not
only of most algorithms in computer science, but also in the
generation of form in the context of biological development.  Complex
mutlicellular life has evolved to exploit the "compression" in
information storage that a recursive growth process affords.

Here is an archetypal example of a recursive branching pattern, that
of a simple bifurcating tree.

Here there are two paramters that may be varied by moving the pointer
across the pane, <b><span id="foo1">parameter 1</span></b>, <b><span
id="foo2">parameter 2</span></b>. An amazing variety of forms can be
generated by varying two very simple parameters.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
B\rightarrow BA \\
A\rightarrow BB
\end{eqnarray}
