<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he underlying
assertion of most goofy new-age claims about quantum mechanics and the
brain is that consciousness is a quantum process. Of course, in a
trivial sense it is quantum insofar that every process in the physical
world seems to obey quantum mechanics. The exact claim is that
something "essentially quantum" is behind the phenomenon of
consciousness, that the computations of the brain actually exploit
uninuitive quantum behaviours that cannot be explained by a classical
physics picture -- the claim is that our brains are quantum computers.

You build a quantum computer by exploiting the fact that a simple,
perfectly isolated physical entity does not act like a tiny billiard,
but rather as a complex-valued wave that isn't in any particular place
at a given time, it's spread out. We say that small systems can be in
"superpositions" of multiple states. Now when the system interacts
with the environment, by hitting a photon from our lasers, say, it
will "collapse" ...( It should be noted that "collapse" is not a real
a-priori physical process, but only an apparent phenomenon. The modern
understanding is that collapse happens when system of few degrees of
freedom interacts with one of very many (the environment) causing the
two to become "entangled" and forcing any given history of the
environment to "see" only one well defined state of the small system
through a process called "decoherence". )... into one state, we will
see the photon bouncing off as though the particle had been at one
particular place.

Quantum computers exploit superpositions by encoding data into the
states of small particles and allowing them to interact and evolve
with each other isolated from the environment in such a way as to
perform a simple calculation without collapsing until the very end
when you measure (read out) the answer. The advantage comes from the
fact that _every possible history_ of the simple computation is
performed in such a way that certain parallel algorithms can try all
the combinatorial possibilities at once before being summoned to give
an answer when they're collapsed. A quantum computer with N bits is
like classical computer with 2^{N} bits.

The key requirement is that the quantum computer _not_ interact with
the environment (stray light, cosmic rays, etc.) during the duration
of the calculation. The more complex the computer, the larger the
number of particles needed to encode the data, the more exquisitely
sensitive the computation becomes to outside noise:

It is _so difficult_ to get more than a few particles isolated long
enough to perform calculations that after about 10 years of effort,
the biggest quantum computer has about 8 qubits. The quantum brain
hypothesis ...( This hypothesis was first proposed by Roger Penrose in
his book "The Emperor's New Mind" and has since captured a generation
of imaginative theorists who never bothered to learn anything about
the brain.)... says that there is some remarkable way that the proteins
of our neurons could form an isolated network of qubits such that the
brain could perform quantum calculations, and that the mysterious
nature of consciousness could be chalked up to the weirdness of its
quantum underpinnings.

There are two major reasons for why this quantum brain hypothesis is
extremely doubtful:

Any time a stray particle hits a quantum computer it collapses back
into a world-entangled state, ruining the computation before it's
finished. The brain is a hot, disordered, massively chaotic place with
countless particles bouncing into everything a billion times a
second. The longest biological quantum superposition known happens in
chlorophyll, and that lasts about a trillionth of a second.

A general, conservative calculation about the survival times of
quantum states in the brain was done by [Max Tegmark][1]
...(quant-ph/9907009, Phys. Rev. E, 61, 4194-4206 )..., suggesting a
trillionth of a second as the limit.  Now, biology certainly _does_
exploit quantum effects _at the timescales at which they happen in
cells_. i.e. quantum effects influence photosynthesis ...(Gregory
S. Engel, et. al. "Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through
quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems" Nature 446, 782-786 (12
April 2007))... and the electron transport chain of respiration. Natural
selection cannot select for life that uses extremely short-lived
physical processes to perform long-lived tasks.

Mental phenomena seem to be explicable solely in terms of the
electrical spikes neurons use to signal with each other. i.e. In
animal experiments, we can see that the external information of sight
and sound is encoded in the frequency and pattern of these spikes in
populations of neurons. Controlling these electrical signals
artificially seems to influence animal behaviour in a predictable
fashion.

We are still very much in ignorance of the brain's operation, but not
so much at the level of its biophysics. More so in the level of detail
about how these signals work across the hundred billion or so neurons
of the brain, and how individual neurons alter their connections and
sensitivities over time to other neurons. The fastest of these
processes happen at the _millisecond_ timescale, meaning that any
quantum process is much too fleeting to influence the phenomenon we
know to be directly involved in neural computation, by a factor of at
least 10^{9}!

The consensus scientific opinion is that the brain acts as a massively
parallel, stochastic, ...(The one thing quantum mechanics does provide
is a kind of guarantee of absolute, true "randomness" at the level of
the particles that make up the brain.  This in turn provides a kind of
basic guarantee of _non-predictability_ for human actions.)... and
_classical_ computer. Whatever the "secret" to consciousness is, it's
not quantum superposition.
