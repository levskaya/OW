The Library of Babel was conceived by the inimitable [Jorge Luis
Borges][1] and stands as one of the greatest metaphors for
combinatorial potential ever penned.

A brief excerpt from the unnamed narrator, a native of the library:

>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an
>indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with
>vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of
>the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower
>floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty
>shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two;
>their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely
>exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a
>narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the
>first and to all the rest...
>
>...there are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf
>contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four
>hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some
>eighty letters which are black in color.

Based on this description, it is possible to calculate the size of the
Library of Babel, presuming that it is a finite universe containing
every possible book.

410 pages/book x 40 lines/page x 80 letters/line = _1312000_ letters per book

There are _25_ different letters.

This means that there are:

25^{1312000} = 10^{1834097} possible books.

4 walls/room x 5 shelves/wall x 35 books/shelf = __700__ books/room

Implying that there are __10^{1834094}__ hexagonal rooms in the
Library.  If we assume each room to measure some 80 cubic meters, then
one expects the approximate _linear_ extent of the universe to be:

(80 x 10^{1834094})^{1/3} = __10^{611365}__ meters

Compare it to the size of the known, visible universe: a mere __10^{27}__ meters.

__10^{1834014}__ of our visible universes could fit into the Library of Babel.

This is the nature of our Reality.  It is but a tiny mote couched
inside a sea of potentiality of mathematical vastness.

There is a vast amount of room between the singular and the infinite.

consciousness as an illusion of travelling sparsely inside a
vast,vast,vast world of possibility, the illusion of free will, why
philosophers deeming themselves worthy to ponder constructs far beyond
those directly accessible to our language.

There are many ancient metaphors for the mystery of the Infinite.  One
of the prettiest comes from the Avatamsaka Sutra:

> ...far away in the heavenly abode of the great god indra, there is a
> wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such
> a manner that it stretches out indefinitely in all directions. in
> accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has
> hung a single glittering jewel at the net's every node, and since
> the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in
> number. there hang the jewels, glittering like stars of the first
> magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. . .
>
> if we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and
> look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface
> there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in
> number. not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one
> jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that the process of
> reflection is infinite...

But because the infinite defies extent, we must concede that any story
approaching it must in the end resemble a child with its mouth gaping
open.  It is far stranger for us to recognize the vastness of the
Finite.
