TODO
======

FIX the RSS feed mechanism
-> map margin notes to footnotes
-> render tex fragments to images
-> weird visual shit needs to have a static img representation such that some small part of it can go out to 
   rss readers

- figure out image dim control in md
- modification of templates on-the-fly to either include or not include i.e. d3 scripts and other large media


YAML, jinja, markdown, LaTeX, HTML, scripts

vs

HMTL, LaTeX
